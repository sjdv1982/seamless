help: 'Creates an NGL viewer for molecular structures.
  See https://nglviewer.org/ for more info on NGL.


  Arguments:


  - structures: a cell that contains either a single molecular structure or a dict of structures.


  - representation. A cell containing a dict of NGL representations in JSON format. 
  If the cell is empty, it is filled with a default representation value.
  The representation dict contains keys that correspond to the keys in the "structures"
  dict. If the key is absent, the representation under key "DEFAULT" is used.


  A representation contains the following keys:

  * type: an NGL molecular representation type, such as "cartoon". 
    See http://nglviewer.org/ngldev/api/manual/molecular-representations.html for an overview.


  * params: the parameters of the representation. Most common options are:


      + "sele": containing an NGL selection (https://nglviewer.org/ngl/api/manual/usage/selection-language.html)


      + "color": which contain a color name such as "red", or 
         various color schemes, see https://nglviewer.org/ngl/api/manual/usage/coloring.html
  

  See http://nglviewer.org/ngl/gallery/ for examples of representations.


  - format: describes the format of the molecular structure. This must be a file extension
  understood by NGL (https://nglviewer.org/ngl/api/manual/file-formats.html). In addition,
  it must be a text format (i.e. no MMTF or trajectory files).


  If there are multiple structures, the format is extracted from the dictionary key of the
  "structures" dict. For a dictionary key that contains no ".", the value of the "format"
  parameter is used.


  Example:

  "format" parameter: "pdb"


  "structures" dict: 
  
  {

    "struc": ....       => pdb

    "receptor": ....    => pdb

    "1cvj.cif": ...     => cif

    "ethanol.mol2": ... => mol2

  }


  - title: the title of the component instance. Default: "NGL viewer"


  - viewer_height: the height of the viewer, with a unit specifier ("px" or "%"). Default: "500px".


  - viewer_width: the width of the viewer, with a unit specifier ("px" or "%"). Default: "500px".


  In the final HTML, a div element called "nglviewer_X" is created, which will
  contain the viewer with the width and height as specified.
