"""Access to Seamless standard graphs, stored in /seamless/graphs/.
The main function of the standard graphs is to aid in translation,
in particular:
    - multi-file modules
    - compiled transformers
    - bash transformers without Docker
    - bash transformers with Docker
(there other graphs in that directory, related to visualization, 
but these are simply copied once into a new project)

This file contains facilities to load standard graphs, 
and to manipulate them (and hence influence translation) dynamically.
