def reactor(params):
    """Defines a reactor.

Reactors react upon changes in their input cells.
Reactors are connected to their input cells via inputpins. In addition, reactors
may manipulate output cells via outputpins. Finally, a cell may be both an
input and an output of the reactor, by connecting it via an editpin.
The pins are declared in the `params` parameter (see below).

All reactors have three implicit inputpins named `code_start`,
`code_update` and `code_stop`. Each pin must be connected to a Python cell
containing a code block.

The reactor will start as soon as all input cells (including the three code cells)
have been defined. The startup of the reactor will trigger the execution of the
code in the `code_start` cell.

Any change in the inputpins (including at startup)
will trigger the execution of the `code_update` cell. The `code_stop` cell is
invoked when the reactor is destroyed.

Unlike transformers, reactors are not cached. Re-evaluation of reactors in a macro
destroys and re-creates all reactors created by the macro.

All three code cells are executed in the same namespace. The namespace contains
an object called `PINS`. This object can be queried for pin objects: a pin
called `spam` is accessible as pin object ``PINS.spam``.

Every inputpin and editpin object contains a ``get()`` method that
returns the value. The `value` property is identical to ``pin.get()``.

Every inputpin and editpin object has a property `updated`, which is True if
the pin has been updated since the last time `code_update` was executed.

Every outputpin and editpin has a ``set(value)`` method.

All reactors are synchronous (blocking): their code is
executed in the main thread of the main process.
Therefore, Seamless and IPython are non-responsive
while reactor code is executing, and reactor code should return as soon as
possible. Therefore, if they perform long computations, reactors should spawn
their own threads or processes from within their code.

Invoke ``reactor.status()`` to get the current status of the reactor

``pin.connect(cell)`` connects an outputpin to a cell

``cell.connect(pin)`` connects a cell to an inputpin

``pin.cell()`` returns or creates a cell that is connected to that pin

Parameters
----------

    params: dict
        A dictionary containing the reactor parameters.
        Each (name,value) item represents a reactor pin:

        -  name: string
            name of the pin

        -  value: dict
            with the following items:

            - pin: string
                must be "input", "output" or "edit"
            - dtype: string or tuple of strings
                Describes the data type of the cell(s) connected to the pin.
            - must_be_defined: bool
               default = False

               In case of edit pins, if `must_be_defined` is False, the reactor
               will start up  even if the connected cell does not yet have a
               defined value.
