# Interactive collaborative web server

To run this example, open the project notebook (`webserver-example.ipynb`).

For this example, an empty Seamless project was generated using `seamless-new-project webserver-example`.

To the empty project notebook, a simple workflow has been added. First, a version that does not use Seamless, in three parts. Then, the Seamless version, with the same three parts.

The workflow is minimalist, but shows a combination of Python and command line tools, as is typical in bioinformatics.

In this example, typically only the final result is shown. In contrast, the `webserver-demo` gives a more step-by-step explanation on how to convert an existing workflow to Seamless.
