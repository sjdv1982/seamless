Creates index.html and index.js from a webform generated by generate-webform.py

Does not normally need to be modified

JSON parameters for components:

- file

If True, for every cell "c" that has this component, 
add a property "c_FILENAME" to the Vue model
(in addition to Vue property "c", which is always added).

This property is watched, and when it is changed,
property "c" is updated with the file value (File.text()), 
using the file_upload method on the Vue app
