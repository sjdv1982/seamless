# Mounting to the file system

The purpose of mounting cells (and transformer pins) to the file system is that you can use editors (text editors, IDEs, image editors) on your computer to edit and visualize a cell *while you develop a Seamless workflow*. Mounting has no influence whatsoever on the execution of the workflow.
