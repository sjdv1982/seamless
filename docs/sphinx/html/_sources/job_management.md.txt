# Job management

The purpose of job management is the remote (over the network) execution of Seamless transformations, either by another Seamless instance, or by a job manager. In the [seamless-tools repo](https://github.com/sjdv1982/seamless-tools) there exists an experimental job manager for Seamless named "jobless".

***IMPORTANT: This documentation section is a stub.***

Relevant tests:

- See the [seamless-tools repo](https://github.com/sjdv1982/seamless-tools), in particular the jobless section.

- For a very detailed understanding, the low-level communion tests (see https://github.com/sjdv1982/seamless/tree/stable/tests/lowlevel/test-list.txt)
