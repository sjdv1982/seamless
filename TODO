Imminent:
/seamless/bin/seamless already works, but other tools in /seamless/bin do not,
  since they require SEAMLESS_TOOLS_DIR to be defined (devel Conda only)
Harmonize /seamless/bin/seamless with /seamless-tools/seamless-cli
  (seamless-upload-XXX is already in both)
To test: get-file-and-directory test should work, both /tests/cmd and /tests/highlevel versions

- Add --file and --list arguments to /bin/seamless. Mapping will be the same as for other filest. Works for directories, too. --rawlist will do no mapping, i.e. as if -W. Make tests.

- Try to revert https://github.com/sjdv1982/seamless/commit/a95b55a68bc747ca8aa1661037497ef4981d695e
Instead, forbid inline assignment completely
To test: re-run headify, re-run all tests/highlevel with "bytes" in the source

workflow style embeds workflow style: yes, with a special API (stdlib.map)
workflow style embeds Python style: yes
workflow style embeds cmd style: 
        for pure bash: yes, but requires work (canonical interface for federation). 
        for nested invocation (scripts containing /bin/seamless commands): see "cmd style embeds cmd style".

=============================

TODO before 0.12 release: 

- Add singularity support for bashdocker jobs. DONE

- Fix https://github.com/sjdv1982/seamless/issues/246 (both issues). DONE

- Add local fairserver test. Rip the RPBS fairserver, create add_fairserver API. Adapt reproducible PDB viewer and deepcell-pdb / deepfolder-pdb. DONE

- Add bufferdir-deploy-deepfolder tool (checksum => ./deployed/<folder>, either hardlinks or softlinks into bufferdir). DONE.

- Make sure that bash jobs with a buffer read folder have get_filename working directory. Rip filezones. Use bufferdir_deploy_deepfolder, then test get_directory feature. Test with /bin/seamless as well! DONE.

- Make sure that save_vault respects scratch (i.e. make it behave the same as buffer_remote.write). Also for save_zip. DONE


- Clean up seamless-tools/database-* tools: DONE

- revive database-run-actions. DONE.

- Re-run pin-filesystem.sh tests. DONE

- Make sure the examples can function without RPBS buffer server, or add it in the notebook. DONE

- Document the vault + database path as a valid (advanced-use) setup. Rip the warning in init_database_from_env, refactor/document API. DONE

- Overhaul serve-graph by adding delegation. Test load-vault/add-zip as well. Run tests/examples requiring serve-graph. DONE

- Re-review new-project. Read some settings from a project.yaml... TODO (delegation!). Always assume (verify?) Docker availability. Have an IPython-or-Jupyter mode config var. Perhaps have a load-project.bash as well? TODO.
    
======================

- Fix issue #249, re-run cmd/headify test. Issue seems to prevent federation (last line of headify/test.out is too slow)

- Clean up and re-run all tests.
    * low-level (DONE)
    * fairserver (DONE)
    * cmd (DONE)
    * high-level (DONE for fully automatic; TODO for others)

- Make sure to add the correct scripts and wrappers from /seamless/bin and /seamless-tools/utils into the Docker images (rpbs/seamless and seamless-devel). Currently, /seamless-tools/utils is not mounted at all, therefore seamless-upload fails. /seamless-tools/seamless-cli/seamless-upload-vault also doesn't seem to work. As tests, run /lowlevel/pin-filesystem.sh, /highlevel/pin-filesystem.sh, /highlevel/get-file-and-directory.sh, /cmd/highlevel/get-file-and-directory.sh
TODO, but nested /bin/seamless works for devel

- Documentation. 

- Document: buffer read servers/folders fail silently, the buffer write server must succeed

- General documentation, describing the three styles. Old TODO entries have been added to the Seamless Documentation issue.

- For seamless-cli, when distributing, be sure to add hashserver to the cli directory. No deps since they are inside the Dockerfile.


- Make a separate conda package for bin/seamless. 
Add seamless-upload, seamless-upload-zip, seamless-upload-vault and seamless-download as copies of seamless-tools/scripts/upload.py etc.,
rather than the Docker wrappers of seamless-cli/seamless-upload etc. However, do add bin/seamless to the Docker images for nesting (DONE for devel image)

- Maintain a Conda environment file for development that updates seamless-minimal-dependencies. DONE

- Rip seamless-minimal. DONE

- Update the seamless-framework Conda environments. Here, *also* install seamless-cli so that tools and seamless Docker container can be fired up at will. *Mark all Conda environments with
SEAMLESS_CONDA_ENVIRONMENT=1*, this is so that seamless-bash will work from within the Conda environment.

- Port dask-deployment build-environment-devel to build-environment. Take seamless-mini environment as a basis where to install Dask libraries into.
Explain this in the delegation documentation.

- Port run-db-hashserver-devel to non-devel environment for distribution.

- Document the various packages/installation methods.
    * seamless-minimal has been ripped
    * The Conda environment will have co-equal status with the Seamless Docker image
    * Note that even the Conda environment still requires Docker to make delegation work. Mini and micro assistants require Seamless Docker image as well.
    If you don't have Docker, either use no delegation (bad!), or set it up via HPC/Dask-oriented tools (run-db-hashserver.sh + dask-deployment tools). The latter option is advanced use case. Document delegation and why!

======================

- After release: fix cloudless, rip communion-related parameters, always invoke delegation.
