TODO before 0.12 release: 

- Make sure that bash jobs with a buffer read folder have get_filename/get_directory working directory. Rip filezones. Test with /bin/seamless as well.

- Make sure that save_vault respects scratch (i.e. make it behave the same as buffer_remote.write). Document the vault + database path as a valid (advanced-use) setup. Rip the warning in init_database_from_env, refactor/document API.

- Re-review new-project, add delegation? UPDATE: read it from a project.yaml...

- Clean up seamless-tools database tools and revive database-run-actions.
Make sure it is usable from both bin/seamless and workflow seamless.
Re-run pin-filesystem.sh tests.

- Clean up and re-run all tests.

- Run tests/examples requiring serve-graph, add seamless.delegate if needed

- Make sure the examples can function without RPBS buffer server, or add it in the notebook

- Documentation. 

- Document: buffer read servers/folders fail silently, the buffer write server must succeed

- General documentation, describing the three styles. Old TODO entries have been added to the Seamless Documentation issue.

- For seamless-cli, when distributing, be sure to add hashserver to the cli directory. No deps since they are inside the Dockerfile.

- Make a separate conda package for bin/seamless. 
Add seamless-upload, seamless-upload-zip, seamless-upload-vault and seamless-download as copies of seamless-tools/scripts/upload.py etc.,
rather than the Docker wrappers of seamless-cli/seamless-upload etc.
