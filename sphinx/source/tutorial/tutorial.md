## Part A. Getting started

### A1. How to use Seamless

Seamless is meant to bring together ...
Intro:

- Seamless CLI
- example (link to simple cells) + status
- new project + status + web form (link to C5.)

  Blurring between programmer and user.
  More like Jupyter than like NextFlow (link)

In-depth (no pre-requisites):

- run from conda environment
- Docker commands
- link: files are bad, database, job manager

### A2. Getting help

Intro:

Intermediate:

- .set, .observe
- Checksums and buffers: async. link to interactive plumbing. 
  ctx.resolve
- Conversion

In-depth:

- Link to polyglot

### B3. Interactive plumbing

Intro:

- Contexts and subcontexts

- Link to web status (point out: if using project)
- Loading from/saving to graph/zip/vault
- Point to beginner's gotchas

Intermediate:

- Independent vs dependent: history doesn't matter, creating a new workflow
- bidirectional link
- Downstream dependency
- preliminary, progress
- clearing exceptions

In-depth:

- Fingertipping, cache misses and irreproducibility (link to transformer)
- Resolving cycles

## Part C. Building interactive workflows

### C1. Jupyter integration

Repeat: more like Jupyter than like nextflow, blurring between programmer and user.
Intro:

- await translation
- traitlets, output

### C2. Mounting to the file system

Intro:

- mount, mode, authority
- Link to E1 (why files are bad)

Intermediate:

- Mount as directory

### C3. HTTP sharing

Intro:

- cell.mimetype
- REST
- Your own web page, Seamless as file server (link to beginner gotchas)

### C4. Web status and web interface generation

Intro:

- Web status
- Web interface

Intermediate:

- Customizing the web status generator
- The Seamless client library (and customize it)
- Adding your own web components

In-depth:

- The metalevel, observers, and understanding the status generator

### C5. Seamless projects

Intro:

- How to set up a project

Intermediate:

- Customize load-project
- Vaults, zips in relation to Git version control

### C6. Beginner gotchas

Intro:

- Import inside code (link to "checksums and buffers")
- Don't forget to translate (link to interactive plumbing)
- Seamless dislikes files:
    - Filename in bash transformer
    - Filename in share
    - Filename in mount
    - Link to "why files are bad"

### C7. Creating help for others

- Managing help contexts, HTML

## Part D. Software development with Seamless
