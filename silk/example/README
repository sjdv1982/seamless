.silkschema.xml => .schema.json                           (needs previous .silkschemas)

.minischema.json + (optional) .silkschema.xml  => pyclass (needs previous silk pyclasses)

JSON schema parser ignores definitions, default, id, description, $schema, pattern
It chokes on anyOf, oneOf, not
$ref must be in the right place: #/definitions/Capital gets ignored, everything else it chokes on (for now)
allOf must be in the right place, too, and only have 2 in the list (no multiple inheritance)
