Run 1 (no seamless)...

Run 2 (seamless, no interface)...

Run 5 (seamless, inferior interface, 2x5 sec sleep)...

real	0m12.925s

Run 5a (seamless, inferior interface, 2x5 sec sleep, repeat)...

real	0m3.414s

Run 999 (seamless, inferior interface, multi-command)...

Run 7 (seamless, canonical interface)...

Run 1000 (seamless, canonical interface, multi-command)...
FAILS because canonical interface is for single-command only

Run 8 (seamless, canonical interface, 2x5 sec sleep)...

real	0m12.907s
user	0m0.992s
sys	0m0.106s

Run 8a (seamless, canonical interface, 2x5 sec sleep, repeat)...

real	0m2.909s
user	0m0.859s
sys	0m0.100s

Run 9 (seamless, inferior interface, 2x5 sec sleep, rename)...
Time should be around 5+2 secs instead of 10+2
The first command of run() is now canonical and federates upon rename

real	0m7.971s
user	0m0.978s
sys	0m0.122s

headify workflow version: should federate and return immediately
ValueError: Multiple canonical commands available.
Please choose one and provide it as the "command" argument.
