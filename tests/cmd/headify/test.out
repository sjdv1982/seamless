Run 999 (seamless, inferior interface, multi-command)...

Run 7 (seamless, canonical interface)...

Run 1000 (seamless, canonical interface, multi-command)...
FAILS because canonical interface is for single-command only

Run 8 (seamless, canonical interface, 2x5 sec sleep)...

Run 9 (seamless, inferior interface, 2x5 sec sleep, rename)...
Time should be around 5+2 secs instead of 10+2
The first command of run() is now canonical and federates upon rename

real	0m6.478s
user	0m2.639s
sys	0m1.875s

headify workflow version: should federate and return immediately
ValueError: Multiple canonical commands available.
Please choose one and provide it as the "command" argument.
