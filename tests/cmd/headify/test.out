Run 1 (no seamless)...

Run 2 (seamless, no interface)...

Run 3 (seamless, partial interface)...

Run 4 (seamless, inferior interface)...

Run 5 (seamless, inferior interface, 2x5 sec sleep)...

real	0m11.580s
user	0m1.747s
sys	0m1.908s

Run 5a (seamless, inferior interface, 2x5 sec sleep, repeat)...

real	0m1.219s
user	0m1.747s

Run 6 (seamless, inferior interface, 2x5 sec sleep, rename)...

Run 999 (seamless, inferior interface, multi-command)...

Run 7 (seamless, canonical interface)...

Run 1000 (seamless, canonical interface, multi-command)...
FAILS because canonical interface is for single-command only

Run 8 (seamless, canonical interface, 2x5 sec sleep)...

real	0m11.615s
user	0m1.878s
sys	0m1.773s

Run 8a (seamless, canonical interface, 2x5 sec sleep, repeat)...

real	0m1.259s
user	0m1.787s
sys	0m1.729s

Run 9 (seamless, inferior interface, 2x5 sec sleep, rename)...
Time should be around 5+2 secs instead of 10+2
The first command of run() is now canonical and federates upon rename
