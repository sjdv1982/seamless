Run 1 (no seamless)...

Run 2 (seamless, no interface)...

Run 3 (seamless, partial interface)...

Run 4 (seamless, inferior interface)...

Run 5 (seamless, inferior interface, 2x5 sec sleep)...

real	0m17.983s

Run 5a (seamless, inferior interface, 2x5 sec sleep, repeat)...

real	0m4.743s

Run 6 (seamless, inferior interface, 2x5 sec sleep, rename)...

Run 999 (seamless, inferior interface, multi-command)...

Run 7 (seamless, canonical interface)...

Run 1000 (seamless, canonical interface, multi-command)...
FAILS because canonical interface is for single-command only

Run 8 (seamless, canonical interface, 2x5 sec sleep)...

real	0m19.236s
user	0m5.475s
sys	0m0.292s

Run 8a (seamless, canonical interface, 2x5 sec sleep, repeat)...

real	0m4.970s
user	0m4.993s
sys	0m0.266s

Run 9 (seamless, inferior interface, 2x5 sec sleep, rename)...
Time should be around 5+2 secs instead of 10+2
The first command of run() is now canonical and federates upon rename

real	0m10.931s
user	0m4.948s
sys	0m0.323s

headify workflow version: should federate and return immediately
ValueError: Multiple canonical commands available.
Please choose one and provide it as the "command" argument.
