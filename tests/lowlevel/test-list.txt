# In general, run with:
#   python3 -u TEST.py > test-outputs/TEST.out 2>&1
#   Best also to test using "ipython3 TEST.py", since re-translation may work differently
#   Before each release, the test set must be run:
#   - under seamless-bash/seamless-run (within Docker)
#   - under seamless-framework (bare-metal conda)

Non-automatic tests
=========================
mount.py:
     - remove /tmp/mount-test
     - run with ipython3 -i
     - then open all files in /tmp/mount-test and manipulate/monitor them
mount-direct.py: see above
mount-cson.py:
     - remove /tmp/test.cson and /tmp/test.json
     - run with ipython3 -i
     - then open /tmp/test.cson and /tmp/test.json, manipulate resp. monitor them
mount-plain.py: see above, minus the .cson

mount.ipynb
compile-debug.py
     - Run with ipython3 -i . 
       Run gdb from a second shell into the container. 
     To make this work, you will need to do one of the following:
     - run the gdb shell as privileged root using "seamless-shell-existing"
     OR
     - disable kernel hardening in your host (/proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope, set the value to 0)
     In GDB:
       attach to the process.
       Type "break addfunc", then "signal SIGUSR1" .
       Type "step", "print(a)", and "cont" (2x)
     print(a) will show 2.
     Afterwards, you will see "ADD 8.141592979431152" in Seamless.
transformation-raw-conda.py
     First run this, and it should give an error
     then install Tensorflow with "pip install tensorflow", and then it should work 
     Make sure that "conda list -f tensorflow" works correctly.

NOTES
=====
[1] This test is about Cython and can also run non-automatically.
- Run with ipython3 -i
- Open cell-ipython.html in the browser and cell-ipython*.ipy in a text editor
- Interpolate cell-ipython.ipy between ORIGINAL and OPTIMIZED,
  and observe the HTML and timings.
