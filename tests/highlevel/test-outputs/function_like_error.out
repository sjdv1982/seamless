The transformer code contains a single function "func" and 2 other statement(s).
Did you mean to:
1. Define the transformer code as a pure function "func"?
   In that case, you must put the other statements within "def func(...):  ".
or
2. Define the transformer code as a code block?
   In that case, you must define the output variable "result", e.g. add a statement
   "result = func(a=a,b=b)" at the end
