Branch to implement imperative DAG-less mode 
(https://github.com/sjdv1982/seamless/issues/130 and https://github.com/sjdv1982/seamless/issues/190)

First, simple "imperative" draft code that can run a transformation w/o database.

DONE
Also for Jupyter, transformer-inside-transformer, and transformer-inside-transformer-inside-transformer
The latter should be supported by innjecting the 'reproducible' object instead.
