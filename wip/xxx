fallback-mount-share.py
  Run with IPython, modify /tmp/a and /tmp/b . 
  This will *not* update ctx.a until you leave fallback mode
  Check "curl localhost:5813/ctx/a"
  Do:
  - fctx.aa = ...
  - ctx.translate(force=True)
  - ctx.a.fallback(None)
  - ctx.a.fallback(fctx.aa)
  - fctx.translate(force=True)
imperative-manyjobs.py
  Needs to be run with a Dask cluster, 1000x ~20 sec jobs. Submitting 1000 jobs may take a few minutes. Will calculate pi to 6 digits. Expected results: 3.141593805644 5.116277454745302e-05 3.141592653589793

multi-core-transformations.py
  It is expected that job 1 finishes before job 2, and job 2 finishes after 7 seconds.
  With DELEGATE, run this with the micro Dask assistant and a local Dask cluster with --ncores 5
  Change ncores to 4 to have the first job fail, for a total duration of 2 seconds
  TODO: as of Seamless 0.12, the first job stays "ready" forever
  Change ncores to 6 to have both jobs execute in parallel. Job 2 will finish after 2.5 seconds,
   and job 1 will still be running.
   TODO: as of Seamless 0.12, the first job says "ready" instead of running
slow-buffer.py
  To detect suspected slowness issues with buffer upload, but hasn't given an error yet.
