docker_gpu: run only on a machine with nvidia-docker2 installed
deepcell-pdb: requires a FAIR server that knows the PDB dataset
                 Can also be run interactively, change ctx.pdb_code 
                  and observe /tmp/pdb_structure.mmcif
deepfolder-pdb: See above . change ctx.pdb_code to "1wej.cif", "1brs.cif" or "7cei.cif" 
                Also, /tmp/pdb_folder will contain 1brs.cif, 1wej.cif and 7cei.cif.
scratch-provenance: 
  This test takes 10-20 minutes
  Need to choose a version (non-reproducibility issue)
    Both versions built using seamless-tools/build-devel-env.sh, seamless-tools commit 22823492f5ab42a5cfb77fc030fcfc126b5d2907
    version 1: 
      Intel Xeon Skylake, Ubuntu 18.04
      Supported SIMD extensions in this NumPy install:
        baseline = SSE,SSE2,SSE3
        found = SSSE3,SSE41,POPCNT,SSE42,AVX,F16C,FMA3,AVX2,AVX512F,AVX512CD,AVX512_SKX
        not found = AVX512_CLX,AVX512_CNL,AVX512_ICL
    version 2:
      Intel i5-1235U, Ubuntu 22.04
      Supported SIMD extensions in this NumPy install:
          baseline = SSE,SSE2,SSE3
          found = SSSE3,SSE41,POPCNT,SSE42,AVX,F16C,FMA3,AVX2
          not found = AVX512F,AVX512CD,AVX512_SKX,AVX512_CLX,AVX512_CNL,AVX512_ICL    
  (Using NPY_DISABLE_CPU_FEATURES does not have an effect)  
   run as "cd scratch-provenance/version; ./run.sh". Requires delegation to be startable from command line ("seamless-delegate" etc. must be available)
